# Sports App

A web-based react application that helps individuals who are looking for a sports partner connect with each other and find nearby sports activities to attend. The application uses Firebase as a backend and also uses Google's Geolocation API to get the coordinates of individuals for optimal partner recommendation. The first part of the project, which is concerned with the individuals, is completed.
